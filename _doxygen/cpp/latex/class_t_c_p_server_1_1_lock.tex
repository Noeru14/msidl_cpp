locks the server in read mode or in write mode. In order to avoid concurrency problems between threads, the callback method that processes requests should instantiate a \hyperlink{class_t_c_p_server_1_1_lock}{Lock} object in the stack. The \hyperlink{class_t_c_p_server_1_1_lock}{Lock} must be instantiated in write mode if the request changes data, or in read mode otherwise. A write lock blocks all other locks (hence, all other threads) until the callback method that issued the write lock returns.

\subsection{Detailed Description}
locks the server in read mode or in write mode. In order to avoid concurrency problems between threads, the callback method that processes requests should instantiate a \hyperlink{class_t_c_p_server_1_1_lock}{Lock} object in the stack. The \hyperlink{class_t_c_p_server_1_1_lock}{Lock} must be instantiated in write mode if the request changes data, or in read mode otherwise. A write lock blocks all other locks (hence, all other threads) until the callback method that issued the write lock returns.
